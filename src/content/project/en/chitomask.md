## Introduction

In the middle of 2021, I had the privilege of applying my knowledge of web technology when approached by a UNAIR student to collaborate on an exciting project. The goal was to build a portfolio website that would serve as a platform to showcase their mask products made from shrimp during the student scientific week (PIMNAS).

The website served as a captivating virtual gallery, displaying the innovative of what products created by the student. Through informative content, visitors could explore what achievement had been reached by students.

Looking ahead, my plan included establishing connection between static website with their e-commerce platform. This strategic integration would not facilitate online transactions but serve as the initial bridge in the product branding process.

## Features & Tech Stack

-   Developed using SvelteKit Framework. By utilizing server-side rendering, the application delivers lightning-fast peformance and ensures an optimal user experience.

-   The application is deployed on Cloudflare hosting, taking advantage of its global CDN infrastructure. This guarantees reliable access and scalability, with reduced latency and faster loading times for users worldwide.

-   The application prioritizes user accessibility and device compatibility, with a responsive design that seamlessly adapts to different screen sizes. Whether it's a smartphone or tablet, users can enjoy the application's functionality

## Lighthouse Peformance

One of the key reasons for adopting a static content rendering strategy is the exceptional performance it offers. When it comes to rendering content, metrics such as First Contentful Paint (FCP), Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) play a crucial role, especially when evaluated using tools like the browser's Lighthouse.

These metrics provide valuable insights into the loading speed and visual stability of a website, enabling developers to optimize user experiences effectively. By implementing a static rendering approach, websites can achieve faster load times, enhance user engagement, and improve overall performance.

## Closing Thoughts

It was an exciting opportunity to contribute to the success of the UNAIR student's venture while gaining valuable experience in web development and product branding.It was my first real world project experience.
